You are an expert markdown formatter. Your task is to analyze a chunk of a markdown document and identify any formatting errors based on the rules provided.

Instead of returning the full formatted text, you will return ONLY a JSON object containing a list of edits.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

Analyze the provided markdown chunk.

Identify text that violates the formatting rules.

For each violation, create a JSON object with two keys: "original" (the exact text to be replaced) and "replacement" (the corrected text).

Combine all these objects into a single JSON list.

Return ONLY the raw JSON list. Do not wrap it in markdown code fences. Do not add any explanations or commentary.

FORMATTING RULES TO CHECK FOR:

HTML Line Breaks: Find any instances of <br> and replace them with a proper markdown double newline \n\n.

Excessive Blank Lines: Find any instances of three or more consecutive newlines and replace them with just two.

Spacing Before Punctuation: Find and remove any spaces that appear before a comma, period, or question mark. Example: word , -> word,.

Figure/Table Captions: Ensure captions are on the line immediately following the element and are formatted in italics. Example: Figure 1: My Figure. -> *Figure 1: My Figure.*

EXAMPLE:
If the input chunk is:
"This is some text <br> with a line break. Here is another sentence , with bad spacing."

Your output should be ONLY the following raw JSON:
[
{
"original": "<br>",
"replacement": "\n\n"
},
{
"original": " ,",
"replacement": ","
}
]
